# ü•ó UK Food Hygiene Data Analysis (MongoDB + Python)

This project uses MongoDB and PyMongo to explore food hygiene ratings across the UK, based on public health inspection data from the Food Standards Agency.

## üîç Overview

The analysis is divided into three parts:

### Part 1: Database Setup
- Import data from a JSON file into a MongoDB collection
- Explore the structure of the dataset
- Use `find_one()`, list databases, and confirm successful setup

### Part 2: Database Updates
- Add a new restaurant ("Penang Flavours") to the database
- Update that entry with a missing business type ID
- Remove all records related to the "Dover" local authority
- Convert string-based fields (latitude, longitude, rating) to numeric values

### Part 3: Exploratory Analysis
- Use queries and aggregation to answer key editorial questions:
  - Establishments with high hygiene scores
  - Top-rated establishments near a specific location
  - Hygiene performance by local authority
